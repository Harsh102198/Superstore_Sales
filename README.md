Task 8 – Superstore Sales Dashboard
📊 Project Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship (Task 8), where I designed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Power BI.
The goal was to visualize sales performance by category, region, and month-year to derive meaningful business insights.

🧠 Objective

To build an interactive dashboard that helps track and analyze:

Sales trends over time (Month-Year)

Comparison of sales across regions and categories

Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as Total Sales, Total Orders, and Average Profit

⚙️ Tool Used

Power BI – For data cleaning, transformation, and dashboard creation

📁 Dataset Columns

Order Date

Month-Year

Region

Category

Sales

Profit

📈 Dashboard Features

Donut Chart: Sales by Category

Bar Chart: Sales by Region and Category

Line Chart: Sales by Month-Year

Line Chart: Sales by Month-Year and Region

Scatter Chart: Count of Region by Sales

KPIs: Total Sales, Total Orders, and Average Profit

Slicers: Region and Category

💡 Key Insights

Technology category contributed the highest share (≈38%) of total sales, followed by Office Supplies (33%) and Furniture (29%).

Central and South regions recorded the highest sales, while Canada and Caribbean had minimal activity.

Sales showed a gradual decline over time, indicating potential seasonality or reduced demand in later months.

A few regions dominate the overall performance, suggesting uneven distribution of sales.
